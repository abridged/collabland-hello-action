This example illustrates how to implement a Collab Action for Discord
interactions.

## Architectural diagram

![collabland-hello-action](./docs/collabland-hello-action.png)

### Prerequisites

Node.js and npm (Node Package Manager) must be installed on your system.

## Get started

Let's try out this `/hello-action` example to see how what Collab Action is
capable of!

### Clone the Action 

```bash
git clone https://github.com/abridged/collabland-hello-action.git
```
### Navigate to the project directory and install the project dependencies

```bash
cd collabland-hello-action
npm install
```

### Build the project

```bash
npm run build
```
Next, follow the instructions on the docs to test the Action

1. [Run the Action Server](https://dev.collab.land/docs/upstream-integrations/collab-actions/getting-started-with-collab-actions#run-the-action-server-locally)

   ```bash
   npm run server -- DhF7T98EBmH1ZFmdGJvBhkmdn3BfAqc3tz8LxER8VH2q
   ```

Next, once you get to play with this simple action, try to implement something new and test it locally

2. [Implement & test your Action locally](https://dev.collab.land/docs/upstream-integrations/collab-actions/getting-started-with-collab-actions#test-the-actions-in-a-discord-server)
